# 🔐 Password-less SSH Authentication – Stratos Datacenter

## 📖 Overview

As part of **xFusionCorp Industries** DevOps security hardening, the system administrators configured **password-less SSH authentication** from the `thor` user on the **Jump Host** to all application servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

This ensures that scheduled automation scripts can connect securely to the app servers without requiring manual password entry, improving both **efficiency** and **security**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Configure password-less SSH for:

  * `thor@jumphost` → `tony@stapp01`
  * `thor@jumphost` → `steve@stapp02`
  * `thor@jumphost` → `banner@stapp03`
* Validate that each connection works without a password prompt.
* Confirm sudo privileges for each respective user.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Generate SSH Keys (on Jump Host as `thor`)

```bash
ssh thor@jump_host
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

* Default location: `/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa` (private), `/home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` (public).
* No passphrase used (automation-safe).

---

### 2️⃣ Deploy Public Key to App Servers

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tony@stapp01     # password: Ir0nM@n
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub steve@stapp02    # password: Am3ric@
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub banner@stapp03   # password: BigGr33n
```

* The first connection requires the sudo user’s password.
* Once installed, subsequent logins are password-less.

---

### 3️⃣ Validate Password-less Access

```bash
ssh tony@stapp01
ssh steve@stapp02
ssh banner@stapp03
```

✅ Successful login without a password prompt.

---

### 4️⃣ Verify Sudo Permissions

```bash
ssh tony@stapp01 "sudo -l"
ssh steve@stapp02 "sudo -l"
ssh banner@stapp03 "sudo -l"
```

* Each sudo user has the expected elevated privileges.

---

## ✅ Outcome

* Password-less SSH from `thor` to all app servers is successfully configured.
* Secure and seamless connectivity is now established for automation scripts.
* Compliance with xFusionCorp security policies achieved.

## 🏷️ Tech Stack

* **OpenSSH** (Key-based authentication)
* **Linux System Administration**
* **Sudo Policy Management**

---

## 📌 Notes

* Always run `ssh-copy-id` from the **Jump Host as thor** (not from within app servers).
* Keys should be generated once and reused across all servers.
