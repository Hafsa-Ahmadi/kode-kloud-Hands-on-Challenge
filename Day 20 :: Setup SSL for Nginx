# 🚀 Nginx + SSL Setup on App Server 3  

This repository documents how we prepared **App Server 3** of **xFusionCorp Industries** for application deployment.  
The task came from the **System Admins Team**, and the requirements were completed step by step ✅  

---

## 📋 Task Requirements
1. Install and configure **Nginx** 🕸️  
2. Deploy the given **SSL certificate & key**  
3. Create an **index.html** with message `Welcome!`  
4. Test application using `curl` from the **jump host**  

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Solution  

### 1️⃣ Install Nginx  
```bash
# On App Server 3
sudo yum install -y nginx      # (CentOS/RHEL)
# OR
sudo apt-get install -y nginx  # (Ubuntu/Debian)

# Start & enable service
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
````

👉 This installs and runs Nginx to serve web pages.

---

### 2️⃣ Setup SSL Certificate & Key 🔐

The SSL cert and key were already present in `/etc/nginx/ssl/`.

```bash
# Verify files
ls -l /etc/nginx/ssl/

# Files should be:
# nautilus.crt
# nautilus.key
```

👉 These files are used to enable **HTTPS** support.

---

### 3️⃣ Configure Nginx for HTTPS ⚡

Create/edit `/etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl.conf`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name _;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.key;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;
}
```

👉 This tells Nginx to serve traffic securely over **port 443**.

---

### 4️⃣ Create index.html 📝

```bash
echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

👉 This is the default landing page.

---

### 5️⃣ Validate Nginx Config ✅

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

👉 `nginx -t` checks syntax, restart applies changes.

---

### 6️⃣ Test Application 🌐

**On App Server 3 (local test):**

```bash
curl -k https://localhost/
# Output: Welcome!
```

**From Jump Host:**

```bash
curl -Ik https://stapp03
```

Expected:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

👉 This confirms SSL and web content are working correctly.

---

## 🏆 Outcome

* Nginx installed & running
* SSL certificate deployed
* Index page with message served over HTTPS
* Verified from both server and jump host

✅ **Server ready for application deployment**

---

## 💡 Points to Remember

* Always test config with `nginx -t` before restart
* Keep SSL files in a secure directory (`/etc/nginx/ssl/`)
* Use `curl -k` to ignore self-signed cert warnings during testing
* Ensure firewall allows **port 443 (HTTPS)**
