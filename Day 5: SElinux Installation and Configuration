# **Task: Install and Disable SELinux (Temporarily) on App Server 3**

## **Purpose**
Following a security directive, the **xFusionCorp Industries** security team required the installation of **SELinux packages** across servers.  
For now, SELinux must be **installed but kept disabled** until further configuration is completed.  

âš¡ **Note:** No immediate reboot is required, since a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned tonight. After that reboot, SELinux should remain **disabled**.

---

## **What is SELinux?**
**Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)** is a kernel security module that provides **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**.  
It enforces strict access control policies beyond standard Linux permissions.

**Modes of SELinux:**
1. **Enforcing** â€“ Blocks and logs violations.  
2. **Permissive** â€“ Only logs violations, does not block.  
3. **Disabled** â€“ SELinux is completely turned off.  

For this task â†’ Required mode is **Disabled**.

---

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### 1. SSH into App Server 3:
```bash
ssh banner@stapp03
2. Switch to root:
sudo -i

3. Install SELinux packages:
yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils

4. Edit SELinux configuration file:
vi /etc/selinux/config


Change:

SELINUX=enforcing


To:

SELINUX=disabled


Save and exit (:wq in vi).

5. Verify the configuration change:
grep SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config


Expected output:

SELINUX=disabled

6. Exit the server:
exit

Important Notes

ðŸš« Do not reboot manually â†’ A scheduled reboot will apply the changes tonight.

ðŸ”„ Current status (sestatus) may still show enforcing/permissive until reboot.

âœ… After reboot, SELinux will be disabled permanently.

End Goal

After the scheduled reboot, the command:

sestatus


Should return:

SELinux status:                 disabled

Command	Purpose
yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils	Install SELinux packages.
vi /etc/selinux/config	Open SELinux config file for editing.
SELINUX=disabled	Ensure SELinux is permanently disabled after reboot.
grep SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config	Confirm configuration file changes.
sestatus	Verify SELinux status (final check after reboot).
