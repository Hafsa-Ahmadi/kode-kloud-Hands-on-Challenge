# Week 2 — Day 14: Nautilus Storage — Copying Developer Data 📦



**How to create a compressed archive `john.tar.gz` from `/data/john` and copy it to `/home` on the storage server so developer John can access it?**

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution 🛠️

**1️⃣ Check the directory and available space 📂**

```bash
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15 "sudo ls -ld /data/john && sudo df -h /home"
```

* **Outcome:** Confirms `/data/john` exists and there is enough space in `/home`.

**2️⃣ Create the compressed archive 🗜️**

```bash
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15 "sudo tar -czvf /tmp/john.tar.gz -C /data john"
```

* **Outcome:** Creates `john.tar.gz` temporarily in `/tmp`.

**3️⃣ Copy the archive to `/home` 📁**

```bash
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15 "sudo cp /tmp/john.tar.gz /home/"
```

* **Outcome:** The archive is now in `/home` for John to access.

**4️⃣ Set permissions and verify 🔑**

```bash
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15 "sudo chown john:john /home/john.tar.gz && sudo chmod 0644 /home/john.tar.gz && sha256sum /home/john.tar.gz"
```

* **Outcome:** Ensures John can access the archive and confirms file integrity.

## 📝 Additional Notes 📝

* ✅ Commands can be run from the jumphost or directly on the storage server.
* ⚠️ If `/data/john` is missing on the current host, switch to the storage server.
* 🛡️ Use `sudo` if needed; otherwise, request an admin to run the commands.
* 💡 Always check the checksum to ensure the archive is intact before sharing.

---

🎯 **Outcome Summary:**

* `john.tar.gz` is safely copied to `/home` on the storage server.
* Developer John has ownership and can access the archive.
* Archive integrity verified with SHA256 checksum.
