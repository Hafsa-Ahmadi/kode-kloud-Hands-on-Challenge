# Day 09 â€“ Fix MariaDB Service

**Objective:**  
Resolve the critical issue where the Nautilus application in Stratos DC was unable to connect to the database due to MariaDB service being down.

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Login to Database Server
```bash
ssh <user>@dbserver1
````

### 2. Check MariaDB Service Status

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```

* Confirmed the service was inactive or failed.

### 3. Start MariaDB Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start mariadb
```

### 4. Enable MariaDB to Start on Boot

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mariadb
```

### 5. Verify Service

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
# OR
mysqladmin -u root -p status
```

* Confirmed the service is **active and running**.

### 6. Troubleshooting (if service fails)

```bash
sudo journalctl -xe | grep mariadb
sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log
```

* Checked logs for errors like **permission issues, missing files, or stale sockets** and resolved them as needed.

### 7. Test Application Connectivity

```bash
mysql -u <appuser> -p -h localhost -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
```

* Verified Nautilus app can connect to the database successfully.
* Optionally restarted the application server to refresh connections:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart tomcat
```

---

## Outcome

* MariaDB service restored successfully.
* Nautilus application can now connect to the database without issues.

---

**Key Learning:**
Always check **service status, logs, and application connectivity** during production incidents. Quick verification ensures minimal downtime.
